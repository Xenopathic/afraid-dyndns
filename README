SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS

INSTALL

    1. log in as root (needed to access config, cron and cache directories):
        # su -
    2. Download the tarball:
        # cd /tmp
        # wget https://github.com/Xenopathic/afraid-dyndns/archive/v${VERSION}.tar.gz

        on OSX, you can use:

        # tar xzvf afraid-dyndns-${VERSION}.tgz
    4. Install:
        # cd afraid-dyndns-${VERSION}
        # ./install

CONFIGURATION

   To configure, edit the /etc/afraid-dyndns.conf file.

   The AccountHash field refers to the SHA value assigned to your
   afraid.org account.  To get it, log into afraid.org and visit:

	   http://freedns.afraid.org/api/

   then click on either of the "Available API Interfaces" links and take
   the value of the "sha" parameter (it's a long string) from the url.

   The Notify address (if present) will be sent e-mail whenever the
   DNS is refreshed.  CacheFile is the file name where the external
   IP address will be cached.
